The research is for exploring the relationship between income per capita and water pollution in Pennsylvania following the traditional view of EKC. Revised models of the relationship between social capital and water pollution and the relationship between water pollution and a combination of social capital and income per capita. In the model, I use both two-way fixed effects model and two-way random effects model. In order to calculate SCI which measures social capital, I use Principal component analysis (PCA) which is a tool used in machine learning for reducing dimensionality. The result turns out that both fixed effects model and random effects model are significant and the shape of SCI is inverted N shape and the shape of income per capita is U shaped. Regarding the shapes of the variables and the trends of the variables we could have some suggestions for local policies.
